                        **Attention!**  
Before running the tests, it is necessary to provide this warning. 
Amazon.com uses "Captcha" as a measure against automation tools. 
Since Captcha is designed as a preventive measure against automation systems, no external operations or libraries have been imported to bypass it.
After running the tests, Captcha must be solved manually. 
I would also like to point out that bypassing Captcha using automation is not ethically appropriate.
